# R-MeLody
The purpose of this project is to provide means to generate automated melodies with R language. 
The melodies follow some melody construction theories and methods. 
The goal is to have Machine Learning available. 
The user might rate the generated melodies. 
The back-end will learn with the user's choices of notes, timing and rhythm and adjust the generation of future melodies.

#TO DO (Lots of stuff)
Extensive debug
Rating Module
Machine Learning module
Responsiveness to Learning (Currently the generation of notes is random based)

Enjoy!
